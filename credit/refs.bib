  abstract={We present the Chapel Hpergraph Library (CHGL), a library for hypergraph computation in the emerging Chapel language. Hypergraphs generalize graphs, where a hypergraph edge can connect any number of vertices. Thus, hypergraphs capture high-order, high-dimensional interactions between multiple entities that are not directly expressible in graphs. CHGL is designed to provide HPC-class computation with high-level abstractions and modern language support for parallel computing on shared memory and distributed memory systems. In this paper we describe the design of CHGL, including first principles, data structures, and algorithms, and we present preliminary performance results based on a graph generation use case. We also discuss ongoing work of codesign with Chapel, which is currently centered on improving performance.},

abstract = {Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the prerequisite for all data science. EDA is non-negotiably interactive—by far the most popular environment for EDA is a Jupyter notebook—and, as datasets grow, increasingly computationally intensive. Several existing projects attempt to combine interactivity and distributed computation using programming paradigms and tools from cloud computing, but none of these projects have come close to meeting our needs for high-performance EDA. To fill this gap, we have developed a prototype, called arkouda, that allows a user to interactively issue massively parallel computations on distributed data.},
